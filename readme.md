Sure, here's how you can integrate the installation steps for Vosk speech recognition models into your README:


## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the Project from Youtube Description

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <your-main-project-directory>
```

3. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. `(Optional)` Install Vosk Speech Recognition Models:
   
   Vosk provides pre-trained models for various languages. To install the models for your desired language, follow these steps:

   - Go to the Vosk GitHub repository releases page: [Vosk GitHub Releases](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/releases)
   - Download the model folder for your language. For example, if you want English models, download the folder named `vosk-model-en-us-aspire-0.2`.
   - Extract the contents of the folder into a directory named `ASSETS` in your project directory.
   - Ensure that the extracted model folder is directly under the `ASSETS` directory, without any additional nesting.
   - Now, you should have a structure like this: `<your-main-project-directory>/ASSETS/vosk-model-en-us-aspire-0.2`.
   - Modify the `main.py` or any relevant script to point to the model directory. For example:
     ```python
     from ENGINE.STT.vosk_recog import speech_to_text

     for speech in speech_to_text(model_path="ASSETS/Vosk/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15"):
        if speech != "":
            print("Human >>", speech)
      ```

5. Run the `main.py` file.

```bash
python main.py
```

Now you're all set to explore the Devs Do Code's project! Enjoy coding!
